# 3D Boids Simulation Design Document

## Overview
A real-time 3D simulation of flocking behavior using Three.js, implementing Craig Reynolds' Boids algorithm in a modern web environment.

## Technology Stack
- **Three.js**: For 3D rendering and scene management
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better development experience
- **Vite**: For fast development and building
- **ESLint**: For code quality
- **Prettier**: For consistent code formatting

## Core Components

### 1. Boid Class
Each boid will have:
- Position (Vector3)
- Velocity (Vector3)
- Acceleration (Vector3)
- Maximum speed and force limits
- Methods for applying flocking rules

### 2. Flocking Rules
Implementation of Craig Reynolds' three rules:
1. **Separation**: Avoid crowding neighbors
2. **Alignment**: Steer towards average heading of neighbors
3. **Cohesion**: Steer towards average position of neighbors

Additional features:
- Boundary behavior (wrapping or bouncing)
- Obstacle avoidance
- Speed limits

### 3. Scene Management
- Camera controls for user interaction
- Lighting setup
- Performance optimization using spatial partitioning

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Setup
- Initialize project with Vite and Three.js
- Set up basic scene, camera, and renderer
- Create single boid representation

### Phase 2: Core Mechanics
- Implement basic boid movement
- Add flocking rules
- Set up boundary behavior

### Phase 3: Optimization & Enhancement
- Add spatial partitioning for neighbor calculations
- Implement obstacle avoidance
- Add user controls for simulation parameters

### Phase 4: Visual Enhancement
- Add visual effects (trails, colors)
- Improve boid models
- Add environment elements

## Performance Considerations
- Use spatial partitioning (Octree) for neighbor calculations
- Implement object pooling for boid instances
- Use efficient vector operations
- Optimize render loop

## User Interface
- Camera controls: Orbit, zoom, pan
- Simulation controls:
  - Number of boids
  - Rule weights
  - Speed limits
  - Visual parameters

## Future Enhancements
- Predator-prey behavior
- Different species with varying rules
- Environmental factors (wind, obstacles)
- Performance monitoring
- Mobile optimization
